# Desicion-tree-regressor-vs-random-forest-regressor
Here I have compared efficiencies of two different models; desicion tree regressor and random forest regressor; on a sample dataset which has multiple independent variables.
It makes sense to use random forest regressor when we have a lot features, doing random forest is almost pointless with two dependent variables.
Strength in the random forest is using a random subset of variables.
